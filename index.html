        <p>
            <font face="NewRomanTimes"><p><font size="12" face="Royal" color="black">A</font><font size="16"></font>eleer Maidens are disciples of the Sun Goddess Aeleer.  They perform many duties around their places of worship, arguably the most important being the delivery of Aeleeri children.  Aeleeri are created when a child is born in a shrine to Aeleer, delivered, baptised, and blessed by one such Maiden.  From there they are raised by the church; they are educated, trained in combat, and taught to help others among other things.  They are raised to be paragons to people.  The Aeleeri can come from any race and as such they contribute to every society.  As always, there are some Aeleeri that reject this path and take that of the radical...   </font>
        </p>
        <h3><font size="5" face="Alegreya">Behavior in Enviornment</font></h3>  
        <p>
            Aeleeri noble and respectable beings wherever they may roam.  Regardless of whether they are a merchant, backsmith, priest, maiden, or warrior they are someone that draw admiration from many.  Aeleeri typically take to a life of peaceful life, concerned with nothing more than helping one another.  There are many who hear the call to arms, and answer without hesitation becoming heroic templars for good.  The few who find themselves on darker paths are truly a danger to all regardless of whether they align with the light or the dark...
        </p>
        <h3><font size="5" face="Alegreya">Relationship with Factions</font></h3>  
        <p>
            Aeleeri have good standing relationships with most factions, their charity and good nature afford them a great level of appreciation from others. An Aeleeri community keeps its doors open to everyone, as long as they’re pure of heart. These areas are immaculate societies tolerant of almost all comers.  It’s not to say that every Aeleeri is religious, or so much as lawful for that matter, but they hold a strong disposition towards all that is good. The Aeleeri are held in a high regard by all for good reason.  From the monsters who fear their tenacity, stoicism, and skill all the way to the good peoples of other land who admire their compassion, charity, and acceptance.
        </p>
        <h3><font size="5" face="Alegreya">Appearance</font></h3>  
        <p>
            Aeleeri can take on many different appearances as they can come from any race or walk of life.  Traits often taken on by Aeleer are golden, glowing, beautiful features.  Those that have scales develop interlocking intricate patterns, while those with hair or eyes retain bright colors for their hair and eyes.
        </p>
        <h3><font size="5" face="Alegreya">Religious Aesthetic</font></h3>  
        <p>
            The churches to Aeleer are grand cathedrals to the Sun Goddess. Each church has some form of hospital to aid and assist members of the convent. The church also typically has living quarters for the less fortunate to stay. These grand places of worship are usually constructed from gold, marble, or other materials of high quality and value. The Aeleer followers themselves tend to look very beautiful with long, silky blond or white hair. They lean towards being more tall and slender in build. Their clothes are usually vibrant in color and modest in design.
        </p>
        <h3><font size="5" face="Alegreya">Description of Followers</font></h3>  
        <p>
           The youth in the church are instructed from communion to learn proper etiquette. This includes learning how to sew, cook, dine, perform, and read. The church itself is charitable to the extreme; they do all they can to spread good faith in Aeleer. Due to this the Aeleer faithful often feed those in need, house the sick or elderly, clothe the less fortunate, and take in Blackwell’s numerous huddled masses. However the duty held most sacred is that of the Aeleer Maidens. The Maidens are leaders of the convents, preachers of Aeleer’s gospel, and most importantly they are the medium for the Aeleeri. It is this last responsibility that puts the Maidens in the highest regard, they literally deliver a manifestation of their Goddess’s will.
        </p>
        <h3><font size="5" face="Alegreya">Description of the Goddess</font></h3>  
        <p>
           The God Aeleer is compassionate and caring to those who are good, truly good, at their core. While she may be a warm and caring deity she is also capable of unleashing wrath and fury unlike any other onto those who aren’t so good natured. Just as the sun outshines the rest of the stars in the sky so too does Aeleer love being the center of attention to the point that she is vain and arrogant. She thinks so highly of herself that she doesn’t bother to wear armor or use weapons. As such she appears to be a serene maiden to onlookers that is motherly and approachable, when she isn’t scorching the impure from the realm of the living that is. When Aeleer roamed the Earth it wasn’t uncommon for solar storms to rage across the land. These solar storms would purge the world and the Cosmic Perpetual of any evil in her presence. These storms encapsulate everything that is Aeleer, beautiful, loving in a way, but destructive.

            <i>“Ah, fancy yourself a huntsman do you? What is it that brought you here? The thrill of the hunt? The glory? Or is it something… more sinister in nature? The life of a huntsman is not for the weak of heart. You will be ostracized by those that do not believe in your cause, whether righteous in intent or vile as the cursed beasts you slay. As a huntsman you are destined to live for the hunt, and die for the hunt. Whatever your cause, whatever your purpose, it matters not. This land of grime and sin, it is the perfect place… *Cough*... For a hunt. You will have to be a skilled huntsman, adept, merciless. Coat yourself in blood, and end the life of these wretched beasts. Now go. Leave with your wits about you. For the night is young, and Hunt has just begun.”</i>

        <p Align = "Right"><qq>-Grimholdt, The First Huntsman</qq></p>
        <h3><font size="5" face="Alegreya">Origins</font></h3>
        <p>
            Originally known as the Hunters of Aeleer, the Huntsman hand picked by Aeleer were sent unto the world to hunt those she deemed unworthy of life. Any signs of heresy were to be expunged by these holy inquisitors in the name of their God. Among these hunters was the first huntsman, Grimholdt. Grimholdt sought audience with the Goddess Aeleer in an attempt to rid the world of this bastion of heresy. Aeleer would grant Grimholdt visions of the future that would shake his belief and cause him to betray his coven. Grimholdt, along with those loyal to him, would break off and form the Night Haunters Coven. The Night Haunters, being blessed with longevity by Aeleer, would dedicate themselves to hunting the beasts of Blackwell and followers of Morne. Wars between the two covens were so commonplace in the early days of Blackwell, the common folk were inspired and sought to change their oppressed lives and began to follow them, idolizing these opposing forces and wanting to join. Now that the Goddess is gone and the Huntsman wars have ceased, the line between the forces have been blurred, huntsman of varying backgrounds have surfaced.
        </p>
        <h3><font size="5" face="Alegreya">Behaviour In Environment</font></h3>
        <p>
            Blackwell provides plenty of prey for the Huntsman, the overabundance of beasts drawing them in. Relishing in the thrill of the hunt, Huntsman lie in wait for the wretched beasts they so desire. To some, Blackwell would seem to be a bastion of desolation and death. But to the true Huntsman it is a playground. Hunting beasts is such a gratification to a proud Huntsman that most would give up food for the thrill of the hunt. But to some their are bigger prey. Huntsman that hunt more intelligent beings. Huntter of the Huntsman seek nothing more but to waste the life of fellow Huntsman. Bordering on mania, these so called hunters achieve levels of ecstasy upon the waste of life that they leave in their path. It is a dangerous and solemn life huntsman live, as any day can be their last. 
        </p>
        <h3><font size="5" face="Alegreya">Relationship with Factions</font></h3>
        <p>
            Huntsman baring the sigil of the Night Haunters are revered by the church of Aeleer. Any believer of Aeleer will treat them with utmost respect and admiration as they are “chosen by the Goddess”. The sigil demands such authority that Aeleer faithful would lay their lives down for their Huntsman. Those bearing the mark of Morne are hated by the church of Aeleer. Any of Aeleer’s faithful will be immediately hostile upon viewing this mark, Followers of Morne will blindly follow orders from the Hunters of Aeleer much like the Aeleer faithful do for the Night Haunters. They’re universally disliked Huntsman type are the Hunters of Huntsman. Bearing the brand of Vrask, they represent the depths of madness that mortals are capable of. Entire towns have been eliminated by Huntsman of this type, leading the commonfolk to be weary of this breed of huntsman. Only madness and destruction are left in the wake of these wretches.
